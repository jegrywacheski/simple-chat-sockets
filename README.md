## Simple Chat App by Jesse Grywacheski

I built this Simple Chat App for practise with websockets, authentication, and user sessions in Node.js.

The Node.js server features *Socket.io Websockets*,  *Passport authentication middleware*, and *Express Session middleware*

The frontend is kept simple using the *EJS view engine* to render data in *HTML*, along with *JavaScript* and *CSS*.

### Run Instructions

To run the application locally, clone the repo:

``` git clone https://github.com/jegrywacheski/simple-chat-sockets.git ```

Make sure to install dependencies:

``` npm install ```

Run the server:

``` node server.js ```

Visit localhost:3000 to register a user. Since the app features sessioning, you will have to use an incognito browser to register a second user.
